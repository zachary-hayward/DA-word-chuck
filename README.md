# Bootcamp week4

- This was a group project, allowed for people to do a word association quiz and get rewarded with a chuck norris developer joke when they got it right.

### Skills
- [ ] Was a great initial play around with API's in a less teacher led fashion.
- [ ] Was lots of communication and sharing of skills and understanding of coding in this group.
- [ ] Had my first successful deployment to the Dokku server Dev Academy had for us without having to get any assistance.
