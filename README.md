# Bootcamp week4

- This was a group project, allowed for people to do a word association quiz and get rewarded with a chuck norris developer joke when they got it right.

### Skills
- [ ] Was a great initial play around with API's in a less teacher led fashion.
- [ ] Was maybe one of the more confident coders in the group so lots of communication and sharing of skills and understanding.
